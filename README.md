# 3D Snake Game

Hi there!  
This is a 3D version of the classic Snake game that I created during my **Bogy internship at Ameria**.

It was a really fun and rewarding project where I learned how to use **Unity** and write gameplay scripts in **C#**.  
A big thank-you to **Benoît Morel** for his help and support throughout the week, it made a big difference.

You can play the game on **Ameria’s 3D interactive screens**, which makes the experience feel much more immersive.

## Game Overview

Control a snake moving across a 3D grid  
Collect bonuses to earn points  
Avoid obstacles, as hitting one ends the game  
Includes sound effects for wins and losses  
Your best score is saved until your snake dies  

## How It Was Built

Developed with **Unity**  
All game logic written in **C#**  
Designed and implemented as part of my internship project  

## How to Try It

1. Download or clone this repository  
2. Open the project in **Unity (2021.3 or newer recommended)**  
3. Open the scene named `GameScene`  
4. Press **Play** and try to beat your high score  

## Final Thoughts

This was my first real game development project, and I learned a lot about programming, Unity, and game design.  
It was a great experience, and I’m proud of how it turned out.

Thanks for taking the time to check it out.
