# 3D Snake Game 

Hi! This is a 3D version of the classic Snake game that I made during my **Bogy internship at Ameria**.

It was a really fun project where I got to learn how to use Unity and write scripts in C#.  
I also want to say a big thank you to **Benoît Morel**, who helped me a lot during the week.

You can play the game on **Ameria’s 3D interactive screens**, which makes it look super cool!

## What the Game Does

You control a snake that moves on a 3D grid  
You have to collect bonuses to get points  
Avoid obstacles or the game ends  
There are sound effects when you win or lose  
Your best score is saved until the snake dies

## How I Made It

I used Unity and wrote all the code in C#  
I made the snake move, added sounds, and created a system to spawn the bonuses  
There’s also a high score system and some obstacles that make the game harder

## How to Try It

1. Download or clone the project  
2. Open it in Unity (version 2021.3 or newer is best)  
3. Open the `GameScene`  
4. Press Play and try to get the highest score!


I’m a student and this was my first real project.  
I learned a lot during my internship and really enjoyed working on this game.

Thanks for checking it out!
