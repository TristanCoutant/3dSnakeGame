# 3D Snake Game

Hello!  
This is a **3D version of the classic Snake game** that I created during my **Bogy internship at Ameria**.

It was a super fun and rewarding project where I learned how to:  
- Use **Unity** for 3D game development  
- Write gameplay scripts in **C#**  
- Create 3D models in **Blender**

A huge thank-you to **Benoît Morel** for his help and support throughout the week. It was incredibly helpful and inspiring.

You can even play the game on **Maverick**, Ameria’s 3D interactive screens, which makes the experience even more immersive!

## Final Thoughts

This was my **first real game development project**, and I learned so much about:

It was a great experience, and I’m really proud of how it turned out.  
Thanks for checking it out. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it!
