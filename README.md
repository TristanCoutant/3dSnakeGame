# 3D Snake Game

Hello!  
This is a 3D version of the classic Snake game that I created during my **Bogy internship at Ameria**.

It was a really fun and rewarding project where I learned how to use **Unity**, write gameplay scripts in **C#** and 3d modelisation with **Blender**.  
A big thank-you to **Benoît Morel** for his help and support throughout the week, it was realy helpful.

You can play the game on **Maverick** Ameria’s 3D interactive screens, which makes the experience feel much more immersive.

## Game Overview

Control a snake moving across a 3D grid  
Collect bonuses to earn points  
Avoid obstacles, as hitting one ends the game 

## How It Was Built

Developed with **Unity**  
All game logic written in **C#**
All 3d Model designt in **Blender**
Designed and implemented as part of my internship project  

## How to Try It

1. Download or clone this repository  
2. Open the project in **Unity (2021.3 or newer recommended)**   
4. Press **Play** and try to beat your high score  

## Final Thoughts

This was my first real game development project, and I learned a lot about programming, Unity, and game design.  
It was a great experience, and I’m proud of how it turned out.

Thanks for taking the time to check it out.
